\title{Trim the data}
\usage{
data.trim(t, data, trimmed = F)

data.trim.d(d, data, trimmed = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Time of interest to pause/stop the study, which could be an interim stage or the final stage.}

\item{data}{There are two possible structures allowed for this input data. The first type needs to have \code{trimmed=F} and include variables: a \code{treatment} variable with "experimental" denoting treatment group, \code{cnsr} variable with value 1 denoting censoring, \code{ct} variable denoting event time from the origin of the study, which equals the sum of entering time \code{enterT} and the survival time (time to event or censoring). A dataset simulated from from R package \href{https://github.com/keaven/nphsim}{nphsim} should fit the first type well enough (see the example1). The second type can be any data.frame or data.table output from a \code{data.trim} function, including variables: \code{ct} denoting event time from the origin of the study or the sum of entering time and the survival time, \code{survival} denoting the survival time or time to event/censoring, \code{delta} as an event indicator, \code{enterT} as entering time (example 2). For the second type, we set \code{trimmed=T} to avoid extra computations, but should be fine if \code{trimmed=F}.}

\item{trimmed}{Whether this data has been trimmed by \code{data.trim} or \code{data.trim.d} before.}

\item{d}{Event counts to pause/stop the study.}
}
\value{
Note that \code{data.trim} only outputs a data.table odered by \code{ct}, the event/censoring time since the start of the study (calendar scale), including variables in the input data.table/frame \code{data}, and additional/updated variables of event indicator \code{delta}, \code{ct}, follow-up time \code{survival} since the enrollment.
\code{data.trim.d} outpus a list of two components. The first component is the data censored with \code{d} events have been observed, ordered by \code{ct}, the event/censoring time since the start of the study (calendar scale). The second component is the time of the stopping point when \code{d} events have been observed.

\description{
Trim the data according to event number or time
}
\details{
\code{data.trim} is to trim the data upto \code{t}, \code{data.trim.d} is to trim the data upto the cound \code{d}.
